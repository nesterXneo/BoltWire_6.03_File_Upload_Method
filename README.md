# BoltWire Post Compromise to RCE Method
*FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY*

This allows attackers to manually upload a PHP reverse shell on BoltWire within the admin panel. 
To do this, admin access is required and the "/dev/pages/" directory must be accessible through a web browser. 

This was tested on BoltWire 6.03.

Step 1: Login to admin page

Step 2: At the top, hit create to create page. Name it shell.php and copy/paste the reverse shell. Click Save.

Step 3: Set up netcat listener. Go to the "/dev/pages" directory and click on your shell.php.
